# Async Data Loader and Saver

This Python application demonstrates how to asynchronously load data from an API and save it to a JSON file using `aiohttp` and `asyncio`. The application fetches posts from the API and saves them incrementally to a file.

## Features

- Asynchronously fetch data from a remote API.
- Incrementally save data to a JSON file.
- Handle API responses and file operations with error handling.

## File Structure

- `main.py`: Entry point of the application. Contains the main function to start data loading and saving.
- `async_Data_Loader.py`: Contains the `AsyncDataLoader` class to handle data fetching and saving asynchronously.
- `data_Saver.py`: Contains the `DataSaver` class for managing JSON file operations.

## Example

To modify the API URL or range of IDs, adjust the parameters in the `main()` function of `main.py`.
